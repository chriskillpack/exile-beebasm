# Exile disassembly (BBC Micro version)

A very WIP disassembly of my favorite BBC Micro game, done in the style of Mark Moxon's [Elite](https://www.bbcelite.com) and [Aviator](https://aviator.bbcelite.com) disassemblies.

### Tools used

[bbc-disasm](https://github.com/chriskillpack/bbc-disasm) - Acorn DFS disk image utility and 6502 disassembler.

[beebasm](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm) - 6502 assembler targeting BBC Micro.
